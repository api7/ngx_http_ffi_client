# ngx_http_ffi_client

`ngx_http_ffi_client` is an OpenResty/APISIX-oriented Nginx C module that will expose a LuaJIT FFI HTTP client API.

The project goal is to let Lua code issue outbound HTTP/1.1 requests through a C implementation that integrates with Nginx/OpenResty event handling, TLS, timers, buffers, and keepalive connection management.

The first implementation target is:

- Lua-facing request/response API for APISIX plugins.
- Nonblocking execution inside OpenResty worker processes.
- HTTP/1.1 over HTTP and HTTPS.
- Keepalive connection pooling.
- LuaJIT FFI bindings in `lib/resty/ngx_http_ffi_client.lua`.

Design notes and implementation plans used during development live under `docs/superpowers/` and are intentionally ignored by git.
